## Summary
The audit process was seamless, efficient and easy to implement based on the code that was written to automate the process. This method would save a lot of time and money when compared to a  manual process. This script can be modified to be used for other elections such as local elections within the county and senate elections as long as the organizational structure of the dataset remains the same.
